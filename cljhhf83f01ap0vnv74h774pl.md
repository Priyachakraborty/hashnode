# Write a Python program to reverse a given list.

```python
n=[1,2,35,4]
print(n[::-1])
```

Output :

```python
[4, 35, 2, 1]
```

The expression `n[::-1]` is used to create a new list that contains the elements of `n` in reverse order. The `[::-1]` part is called slicing with a step value of -1, which means it starts from the last element and goes backward, including all elements.
