# Write a Python program to find the number of occurrences of a given element in a list :

```python
l=[1,2,3,4,4]
j=4
count=0
for i in l:
    if i==j:
        count+=1
print(count)
```

Output :

```python
2
```

It counts the number of occurrences of a given element `j` in the list `l`. The output will be the number of times the element `j` appears in the list `l`.
