This blog is for beginners, who are willing to learn python. Starting from day 1 to day 30. I am going to cover the all basic topics of python that will be helpful for beginners.

# Day 1 :

Starting with a simple python code -&gt;

Remember one thing, Python is a ***high-level programming*** language.

Like, if we see c/c++, we can check out that it’s a compiled language, but python is interpreted language.

* example 1:
    

```python
print("Hello ,everyone")
```

```python
output : Hello ,everyone
```

<mark>The format will be so simple like the upper one as we don’t need any “;” for ending our code.</mark>

* example 2:
    

```python
print('Hii,Techies')
```

```python
output: Hii ,Techies
```

So, from the upper code, if you see that I have used ‘ ’ — only single inverted commas. But if you see the very first example you can check out that I have used “ ” — double inverted commas. That means we can use both. But if you don’t use any commas to print, then you will get an error.

```python
print(hii,all)
```

output:

You will get this type of error if you do not use commas in your code to print the text, this type of error is called a **<mark>Name error</mark>**.

That’s for day 1. Next day we will learn the ***Basic data types*** of Python.

Thank you.
