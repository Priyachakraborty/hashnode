# Write a Python program to sort a given array in ascending order :

```python
a=[2,4,8,1,4,6]
a.sort()
print("The ascending order ",a)
```

Output :

```python
The ascending order  [1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8]
```

The sort() method in Python can be used to sort a list of numbers in ascending order. In the example, the list a is sorted using sort() and the sorted list is then printed to the console using the print() function.

### The sort() method has sorted the list in ascending order, from smallest to largest.
