# Day 4

## List :

Previously I have discussed that,

<mark>A list is a sequential data type</mark>

1. `An ordered collection of data`
    
2. `It is mutable.`
    
3. `It's an abstract data type.`
    

Let's solve a few problems on the list :

1. ***Write a python program to reverse a list***
    

```python
l=[34,76,23,11]
print(l[::-1])
```

output:

this is the easiest way to solve the reverse list by using the slicing operator.

1. ***Write a python program to find out the length of the list***
    

```python
l=[3,6,3,4]
print(len(l))
```

output :

These are the basic code that I have solved by listing, using keywords.

1. ***Write a Python program to print all negative numbers in a range.***
    

```python
n=int(input("enter the first number"))
m=int(input("enter the second number"))
print([i for i in range(n,m+1) if i<0])
```

Output:

Here are some basic questions on the list:

| QUESTIONS |
| --- |
| <mark>Write a python program to swap elements in the string list</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to find the length of the list</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to find a maximum of two numbers in Python</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to find a minimum of two numbers in Python</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to check if an element exists in the list</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to clear a list in Python</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to reverse a list</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to clone or Copying a list</mark> |
| <mark>Write a python program to count occurrences of an element in a list</mark> |
| <mark>Write a Python Program to find the sum and average of the list in Python</mark> |

In my next blogs, you will get to know about loops and their uses.

Thank you.
