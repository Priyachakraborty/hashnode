## Day-12

### While loop :

*While loop, here the loop will run until the given condition is satisfied.*

the basic syntax of the while loop :

> while(expression):
> 
> statement (T)

Let's solve a few problems on the while loop:-

1. Write a program to print 1 to 10 numbers using a while loop :
    

```python
num = 1

while num <= 10:
    print(num)
    num += 1
```

output :

```python
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

1. Write a program to print odd numbers in a range using a while loop
    

```python
start = 1
end = 20

while start <= end:
    if start % 2 != 0:
        print(start)
    start += 1
```

output :

```python
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
```

These are the basic codes using a while loop:-

1. Write a Python program to print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a `while` loop.
    
2. Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.
    
3. Write a Python program to reverse a given number using a `while` loop.
    
4. Write a Python program to find the sum of digits in a given number using a `while` loop.
    
5. Write a Python program to check if a given number is a palindrome or not using a `while` loop.
    
6. Write a Python program to find the GCD of two numbers using a `while` loop.
    
7. Write a Python program to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a `while` loop.
    
8. Write a Python program to implement a binary search algorithm using a `while` loop.
    
9. Write a Python program to find the largest and smallest elements in a list using a `while` loop.
    
10. Write a Python program to simulate a simple guessing game using a `while` loop.
    

In my next blog, you will get to know about python functions.
