# Write a Python program to find the second largest element in an array:-

```python
x=[2,7,3,4,9,0,2]
x.sort()
print("The second largest element is",x[-2])
```

Output :

```plaintext
The second largest element is 7
```

This code sorts the list `x` in ascending order using the `sort()` method and then prints the second largest element of the sorted list using indexing with `x[-2]`.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

* `x=[2,7,3,4,9,0,2]`: This creates a list `x` with seven elements.
    
* `x.sort()`: This sorts the elements of the list `x` in ascending order. After sorting, the list becomes `[0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9]`.
    
* `print("The second largest element is",x[-2])`: This prints the string `"The second largest element is"` followed by the second largest element of the sorted list `x`, which is `7`.
