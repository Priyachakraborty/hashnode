# Write a Python program to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not:-

```python
str=input("ENTER THE STRING : ")
if str == str[::-1]:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

Output:

```python
ENTER THE STRING : eye
YES
```

* The code first prompts the user to input a string using the `input()` function and assigns it to the variable `str`.
    
* The `[::-1]` slice notation is used to reverse the string. This creates a new string that has the same characters as the original string but in reverse order.
    
* The `==` operator is used to compare the original string with its reversed version. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome and the code prints "YES". If they are different, the string is not a palindrome and the code prints "NO".
