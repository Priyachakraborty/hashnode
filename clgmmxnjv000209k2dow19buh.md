## Write a Python program to find the largest element in an array :

```python
a=[56,78,34,90,23,56,34]
a.sort()
print("The largest element is",a[-1])
```

Output:

```plaintext
The maximum element is 90
```

The given code sorts the list `a` in ascending order and then prints the largest element in the list.

After sorting the list, the largest element will be the last element in the sorted list, which can be accessed using the index `-1`. So the code is correct as it is.
