# Write a Python program to find the sum of all elements in an array:-

```python
l=[10,10,10,10,10]
sum=0
for i in l :
    sum+=i
print(sum)
```

Output:-

```python
50
```

It calculates the sum of all the elements in the list `l`. The variable `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum as you iterate through the elements of the list.
