# DAY 3

Today, you will get to know about conditional statements in python.

Conditional Statement is nothing but if-else statements.

---

format of the <mark>if-else statement</mark>:

`if (condition):`

`print("--")`

`else:`

`print("--")`

so the format will look like this.

---

now let's solve a problem :

***Write a python program to check whether the number is odd or even number***\-

```python
n=int(input("enter the number"))
if n%2==0:
   print("The number is even number")
else:
   print("The number is odd number")
```

output:

***Write a python program to check whether the given number is greater than 10 or not, if yes then print, "The number is greater than 10", else print -"The number is less than 10"-***

```python
n=int(input("Enter your number"))
if n>10:
   print("The number is greater than 10")
else:
   print("The number is less than 10")
```

output:

These are the basic programs solved by the if-else statement.

In the next blog, you will get to know about the nested if-else statement.

Thank you.
