## Day 7

### Set :

Set is an in-built data type in python. It is an ***unordered collection*** of data.

> 1. It is iterable
>     
> 2. It is mutable
>     
> 3. It has no duplicates
>     

Let's solve a few problems on set :

1. *Find the maximum and minimum in a Set* :
    

```python
s=([67,34,27,45,1])
print(set(s))
print(max(set(s)))
print(min(set(s)))
```

output :

1. *To convert a set into a list*
    

```python
s={1,6,3,4}
print(list(s))
```

output:

Problems on Set :

1. `Write a python program to check if two lists have at least one element common`
    
2. `Write a python program to find common elements in three lists using sets`
    
3. `Write a python program to find missing and additional values in two lists`
    
4. `Write a python program to find the difference between two lists`
    
5. `Write a python program to find a lost element from a duplicated array`
    
6. `Write a python program to count the number of vowels using sets in a given string`
    
7. `Write a python program to concatenated string with uncommon characters in Python`
    
8. `Write a python program to accept the strings which contain all vowels`
    
9. `Write a python program to check if a given string is a binary string or not`
    
10. `Write a python program to check if the string is an anagram`
    
11. `Write a python program for pairs of complete strings in two sets`
    

In my next blog,you will get to know about dictionary data types.
