# Write a Python program to count the number of words in a given string

```python
#Write a Python program to count the number of words in a given string

word = input("enter the word : ")

split_word=word.split()

print(len(split_word))
```

Output :

```python
enter the word :
Hello learner welcome to my blog
6
```

It takes user input, splits the input string into words using whitespace as the delimiter, and then prints the count of words.
