# Write a Python program to reverse a given string:-

```python
str=input("Enter the string : ")
print('THE REVERSE OF THE STRING IS :-  ',str[::-1])
```

Output :

```plaintext

Enter the string : PRIYA
THE REVERSE OF THE STRING IS :-   AYIRP
```

This is a Python code that takes a string as input from the user, then prints the reverse of the string using slicing. Here's how the code works:

1. The input() function is used to take input from the user. Whatever the user types in are stored in the variable 'str'.
    
2. The slicing notation \[::-1\] is used to reverse the string. The notation means "Start at the end of the string and keep going back until the beginning, with a step of -1". This results in the string being reversed.
    
3. The reversed string is then printed using the print() function.
