## Day-9

### Loops :

Loops are the ***controlled structure*** in the program. There are 2 types of loops in python programming.

1. **For loop**
    
2. **While loop**
    
3. ## FOR LOOP :
    

**For loop is used to iterate a sequence of data items.**

let's solve a problem on for loop :

a. *Write a python program to print 10 numbers using for loop*

```python
n=int(input("enter the number"))
for i in range (1,n+1):
    print(i)
```

output :

1. ## WHILE LOOP :
    

**While loop, here the loop will run until the given condition is satisfied.**

let's solve a problem on the while loop :

a. *Write a python program to print ("Hello world") 3 times using the while loop* :

```python
count = 0
while (count < 3):
	count = count + 1
	print("Hello World")
```

output :

These are the two types of loops in python programming.

***Problems*** :

`Write a program in Python to display the Factorial of a number.`

`Write a program in Python to reverse a word.`

`Write a Python program to reverse a number.`

`Write a program to print n natural numbers in descending order using a while loop.`

`Write a program to display the first 6 multiples of 6`

`Write a program that appends the type of elements from a list.`

`Write a program to find and separate even and odd numbers from a list.`

`Write a program to find only odd values from a dictionary.`

In my next blog, You will get to know in brief about these loops.

Thank you !!
