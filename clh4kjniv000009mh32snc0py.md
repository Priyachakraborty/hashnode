```python
print('Hello Reader !')
```

```plaintext

## üêçConditional Statements:

In Python, conditional statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

*The if statement checks if a condition is True, and if it is, the code inside the if block is executed. If the condition is False, the program moves on to the elif statement (if there is one), which allows for additional conditions to be checked. If the condition in the elif statement is True, the code inside the elif block is executed. If the condition is False, the program moves on to the else statement (if there is one), which is a catch-all that is executed if all the previous conditions are False.*

```python
x = 30

if x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is positive")
```

```python
OUTPUT:

X is positive
```

---

## üêçList, String, tuple, Set, Dictionary :

### üìåList:

An ordered, mutable collection of values. Lists are denoted by square brackets \[\].

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
print(fruits) 
```

```python
 Output: 
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### üìåString:

A sequence of characters. Strings are denoted by either single or double quotes (' or ") and are immutable.

```python
greeting = "Hello, world!" 
print(greeting) 
```

```python
Output: 
Hello, world!
```

### üìåTuple:

An ordered, immutable collection of values. Tuples are denoted by parentheses ().

```python
coordinates = (10, 20) 
print(coordinates) 
```

```python
Output: 
(10, 20)
```

### üìåSet:

An unordered collection of unique values. Sets are denoted by curly braces {} or by using the set() function.

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
print(numbers) 
```

```python
 Output: 
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### üìåDictionary:

An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are denoted by curly braces {} and each key-value pair is separated by a colon ':'.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} 
print(person) 
```

```python
Output: 
{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
```

---

## üêçLoops:

In Python, there are two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list or a string.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

```python
Output:

apple
banana
cherry
```

A while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is True. The basic syntax of a while loop is:

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

```python
Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

Loops are important constructs in programming as they allow you to repeat code without having to write it out manually for each iteration.

---

## üêçFunction:

In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to break your code into smaller, more manageable pieces and can make your code more modular and easier to read.

Here's an example of a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum

x = 3
y = 5
result = add_numbers(x, y)
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {result}")

```

```python
Output:
The sum of 3 and 5 is 8
```

---

## üêçOOPs(Basic Concept)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the concept of objects, which can contain data and code that operates on that data. Python is an object-oriented language, which means it provides support for OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Here's an example of a simple class definition in Python:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start(self):
        print("The car is starting...")

    def stop(self):
        print("The car is stopping...")

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
print(my_car.make)  
print(my_car.model) 
print(my_car.year)  
my_car.start()      
my_car.stop()       
```

```python
Output: 

Toyota
Camry
2020
The car is starting...
The car is stopping...
```
