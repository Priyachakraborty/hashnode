## Day-14

### Object-Oriented Programming(OOPs):

Python is `a high-level programming language` that supports `Object-oriented programming` that includes objects and classes.

*The basic concept of OOPs are* :

* **Class :**
    
    *A blueprint or template for creating objects defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.*
    
* **Object :**
    
    *Instances of a class have their own unique set of data and behavior.*
    
* **Polymorphism :**
    
    *The ability for different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways, depending on their specific implementation. This allows for more flexible and modular code.*
    
* **Inheritance:**
    
    *The ability for a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class allows for code reuse and creates a hierarchical class structure.*
    
* **Encapsulation:**
    
    *The ability to bundle data and methods together within a class, hiding the implementation details from the outside world and providing a clean interface for other parts of the program to interact with.*
    
* **Data Abstraction :**
    
    *Data abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to define the essential features of an object and hide the details of its implementation from the outside world.*
    

These are the basic concepts of OOPs in python.The concept of OOPs is so vast, I will discuss it in my next upcoming blogs with full implementations of real-life examples.
