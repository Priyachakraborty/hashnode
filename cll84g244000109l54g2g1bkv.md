# Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a given list:

```python
l=[2,3,4,5,6,4,2]
print(list(set(l)))
```

```python
Output :
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

The code provided will remove duplicate elements from the list `l` and print the result.

The `set()` function is used to create a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. By converting the list to a set, duplicates are automatically removed because sets only store unique values. Then, `list()` is used to convert the set back to a list, and the resulting list is printed.
