# Write a Python program to find the largest and smallest element in an array:

```python
a=[4,6,2,8,1,3,9,2,5,4,8,0,2,3,5,7,5,2]
a.sort()
print("The largest element is",a[-1])
print("The smallest element is",a[0])
```

Output :

```python
The largest element is 9
The smallest element is 0
```

The `sort()` method is called on the list `a`, which rearranges the elements in ascending order. The list `a` will be modified to `[0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]`.

`a[-1]` refers to the last element in the list, which is the largest element in the sorted list.

`a[0]` refers to the first element in the list, which is the smallest element in the sorted list.
