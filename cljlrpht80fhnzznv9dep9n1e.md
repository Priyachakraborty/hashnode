# Write a Python program to find the product of all elements in an array :

```python
l=[2,2,2,2,2]
mul=1
for i in l:
    mul=mul*i
print(mul)
```

Output :

```python
32
```

The code essentially multiplies each element in the list together, starting with an initial value of `1` for `mul`, and updates `mul` in each iteration.
